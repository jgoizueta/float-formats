== 0.1.1 2007-11-09

*  HP-71B formats defined

*  Add half precision IEEE format (binary16)

*  New names for IEEE formats

*  Add some IEEE 754r interchange formats

*  new methods hex_to_float, hex_from_float in float-formats/native

*  Allow non-bcd values in fields of BCD formats by passing
   hex values as Strings; allow such values to be used for 
   nan/infinity exponents.

*  to/from_integral_sign_significand_exponent methods now
   have the sign as an integer +1,-1 rather than as the
   internal representation 0,1,etc.

*  Handle special values (Infinities and NaN) in #from_fmt, #from_number

*  Add ulp methods to Value and FP classes and to Float
   
*  Bug fixes
    - Fix the encoding-decoding of nan and infinity in Decimal format.
    - Fix the decoding of NaN in Binary & Hexadecimal
    - The definition of IEEE_binary128 was not correct
    - In formats such as XS256 where the minimum exponent is not used only for zero
      and there is a hidden bit, then minimum nonzero significand is radix*(prec-1)+1
      rather than radix*(prec-1); the latter value could be computed in ratio_float
      and then packed in the representation, being replaced by zero. This would
      result in an incorrect encoding of the minimum nonzero value.
